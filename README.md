Hi, I’m Tamara 👋

I’m on a journey from curiosity to competence — learning how to turn ideas into working software, one commit at a time.

Right now, I’m focused on building strong foundations, understanding how things work under the hood, and shipping projects that get better with every iteration. I believe progress beats perfection, and consistency beats talent.

## 🌱 My Present
- Learning core programming concepts and modern development tools  
- Building small but meaningful projects to sharpen real-world skills  
- Studying code not just to make it work, but to make it make sense  
- Growing through mistakes, refactors, and late-night debugging  

## 🚀 Where I’m Headed
I’m working toward becoming a developer who:
- Writes clean, readable, and maintainable code  
- Builds solutions that solve real problems, especially in underserved spaces  
- Contributes to open-source and collaborative projects  
- Keeps learning — because tech never stops moving  

## 🧠 What I Value
- *Clarity over complexity*  
- *Learning over ego*  
- *Impact over hype*  
- *Discipline over motivation*  

## 🛠 Tech I’m Exploring
- Programming fundamentals  
- Web technologies  
- Problem-solving & algorithms  
- Version control and collaboration (Git & GitHub)

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here
- Learning projects and experiments  
- Practice repositories as my skills evolve  
- A visible trail of growth, not just polished results
